public class Algorithms {
    /*
    ALGORITHM: A set of detailed steps to reach a certain goal. It is written steps, not code.
    IMPLEMENTATION: Implementing an algorithm through a programming language, such as Java.
    Time Complexity: The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete depending on its inputs.
    Space Complexity: The amount of space an algorithm requires depending on its inputs.
    Big-O notation: A mathematical notation that describes how time and space complexity scales
    as the input approaches infinity. CONSTANTS ARE IGNORED!

    O(1) (Constant Time): Time to complete stays the same regardless of input.
    O(n) (Linear Time): Time scales as the input increases.
    O(n^2) (Quadratic Time): Time scales squared as the input increases.
